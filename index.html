    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>History</h3>

<p>
Our pet store was registered in 2003 in Durham. The Durham house is our first campany and we are happy to be able to build our division here. We have a lot of experienced researchers with long sales experience. We have sales of family pet products, which is something we are very good at. At the same time, we have also obtained a large number of loyal users, and we also hope to help more families with pets in Durham.

    <h3>Why Use Us</h3>

<p>
We are committed to helping families with pets. Pets are my best friends, sometimes they are like family members. Therefore, for these pet products, we will undergo strict screening, and each product is a product that we have approved after actually using it. Our advantage is to treat our customers with maximum security. Second, each of our employees is highly trained and has strong business skills to help clients solve most of their pet problems. Our philosophy is the love of pets.
